# TwitchAntiQualitySwitcher

Prevents the Twitch player from switching quality when switching tabs!

The Twitch player switches to 480p after a minute of the tab not being active and it can be disorientating when you're listening to a stream and tab back in to see what is happening, seeing everything blurry then skip back to full quality after the moment is over. This extension prevents that.
